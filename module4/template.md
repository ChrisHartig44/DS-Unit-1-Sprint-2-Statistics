# Assignment!

Fill out the template *twice*, for two different ideas.

Then compare and contrast and select one as the idea you're leaning towards
working on for your project week.



After exploring the two ideas, I think I would like to use the world suicide data and explore how suicide is impacted by GDP per capita. 


# Ideas for data storytelling - Idea 1

## You

What do you care about?
Movies

What do you know about?
How different kind of movies perform at the box office

What decisions do you face?
Should I see a movie in theaters-or wait until it comes out on streaming? Should I do research before seeing a movie? Or should I go in as cold as possible?

## Seven templates

Training Kit (https://learn.lambdaschool.com/ds/module/recedjanlbpqxic2r) explains the seven templates from Priceonomics.

Can you apply the templates to your topics? 

1. Geographic Variation
It might be tough, although I could always look at the US vs Worldwide box office.

2. Trend related to the news
The Oscars are coming up in February, so that might be an interesting frame for the blog post.

3. Who does that?
Movies are products, I'm just not sure the demographic information would be widely available like they would with TV ratings.

4. Answering a question people care about
Maybe I could find data regarding how profits for concession sales compare to ticket sales.

5. Valuable to businesses
I'm sure the movie studios know about whatever conlclusions I come to. Although it might be able to make interested consumers more informed.

6. What's the most popular?
I could explore how the most popular movies critically do at the box office and how the best performing movies at the box office do with the critics.  

7. Cost/Money rankings
Similar to number 6. I could also compare the relationship between production budget and box office returns to see if studios and deft at picking the right projects to invest in.

## Misconceptions

What misconceptions do people have about your topic?
I'm sure people assume that how well a movie does with crtics has nothing to do with its box office performance. 

## Examples

What data storytelling example inspires you?
https://www.kaggle.com/carolzhangdc/predict-imdb-score-with-data-mining-algorithms

Definitley more involved than what is asked for in class, but I love how thorough this example is.

Could you do a new hypothesis, for the same question?
Genre has a large impact on a movie's IMDb user score

Could you do a new question, for the same topic?
Are recent films more likely to receive high IMDb User scores?

Could you do a new topic, with the same "style"?
Does a beer's style have a relationship to its score on BeerAdvocate

## Data

Where could you search for data about your topic?
Rotten Tomatoes

# Ideas for data storytelling - Idea 2

## You

What do you care about?
Mental health

What do you know about?


What decisions do you face?


## Seven templates

Training Kit (https://learn.lambdaschool.com/ds/module/recedjanlbpqxic2r) explains the seven templates from Priceonomics.

Can you apply the templates to your topics? 

1. Geographic Variation
Would be very simple. I could compare different mental health statistics in different states or countries. (suicide, depression, happiness index)

2. Trend related to the news
I could compare how different mental health statistics compare to the past.  

3. Who does that?
It wouldn't be a product, but it probably wouldn't be that hard to find demographic information 

4. Answering a question people care about
I could foucs on the more impoverished countries and show how their issues differ from the more developed countries. I know I use to assume that people in poorer countries would have more mental health issues, but that's not always the case.

5. Valuable to businesses
Would be hard. Maybe I could look at rates at which people are medicated (that data may be tough or impossible to find) That would be of interest to pharmaceutical companies to see different attitudes towards medication across cultures.

6. What's the most popular?
I could look at what countries have the most extreme mental health issues.

7. Cost/Money rankings
I could rank the cost of health care in countries since that's related to mental health and healthcare costs are something that most people care about. 

## Misconceptions

What misconceptions do people have about your topic?
Some people assume that people who live in poorer countries are more depressed when depression is found more often in wealth, developed countries.

## Examples

What data storytelling example inspires you?

https://www.apa.org/monitor/2019/03/trends-suicide

Really simple example that's very clear and easy to read. I'm sure I could do something more complicated. 

Could you do a new hypothesis, for the same question?
Suicide rates are falling worldwide

Could you do a new question, for the same topic?
How does GDP growth affect the change in the suicide rate?

Could you do a new topic, with the same "style"?
How does GDP growth affect life expectancy? 

## Data

Where could you search for data about your topic?

https://www.kaggle.com/russellyates88/suicide-rates-overview-1985-to-2016

https://www.kaggle.com/unsdsn/world-happiness

Although these might be too widely used.
